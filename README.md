# Quay Workshop Instructions
Getting started with Quay

This workshop will guide students through the various features of Quay version 3.x. It's applicable to anyone who wishes to get hands on managing container images with Quay.

Your instructor should assign you a user number. Several of the lab exercises in this workshop will require you to insert your user number to perform an operation. For example, the lab guide may ask you to enter your username and state `userX` as the example. If you are user number `1`, you would change this value to `user1` instead of `userX`.

## Instructor Notes
This workshop can be run on any OpenShift 4.x cluster with Quay 3.x deployed. It can also be done on a Quay instance deployed in HA on virtual machines, although the preferred architecture is Quay on OCP 4.x. You can deploy on top of a vanilla OCP 4.x cluster in RHPDS

To run this workshop in homeroom. Please login to your Openshift via the CLI

```
oc login
```
Please create a homeroom project.

```
oc create namespace homeroom
oc project homeroom
```

Deploy the homeroom spawner.

```
oc process -f \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afouladi7/quay-workshop/master/templates/hosted-workshop-production.json \
    -p SPAWNER_NAMESPACE=homeroom \
    -p CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN={{ your_cluster_url }} \
    -p WORKSHOP_NAME=quay-workshop \
    -p CONSOLE_IMAGE=quay.io/openshift/origin-console:4.9 \
    -p WORKSHOP_IMAGE=quay.io/redhatgov/quay-workshop:latest \
    -p CUSTOM_TAB_1=Webhooks=https://webhook.site | oc apply -n homeroom -f -  
```

```
oc create namespace quay
oc project quay
```

Once the pod is up and open the URL.

Please navigate to the homeroom project in Openshift, under the developer view. You should see the quay operator pods already up and running.


## If you already have an existing Openshift 4 Cluster

If you are running an existing Openshift 4 cluster and would like to run the quay workshop there. Please navigate to the "Operators" tab under the Administrator's view. 

* Click on OperatorHub

* Search for "Red Hat Quay" & install

Once installed navigate back to your terminal screen and locate or create the `.dockercfg` file by doing one of the three following steps

* If you already have a `.dockercfg` file for the secured registry, you can `cp <path/to/.dockercfg> config.json`

* Or if you have a $HOME/.docker/config.json file, you can `cp <path/to/.docker/config.json> config.json`

* If you do not already have a Docker credentials file for the secured registry, you can create a secret by running the following


```
oc create secret docker-registry redhat-pull-secret \
    --docker-server=<registry_server> \
    --docker-username=<user_name> \
    --docker-password=<password> \
    --docker-email=<email>     
```

Finally run the `./install-script`
