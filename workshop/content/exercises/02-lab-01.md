## Create Quay Secrets

You will need to create the quay secrets, before we get started.

Run ```install-script``` to create Openshift secrets.

```execute
./install-script
```

Please give your email address, desired username, and password.

Please allow up to 5 minutes for all instances of quay to come up. It should look like the following.

## Login to Quay
Once all pods are up, please either click on the `quayecosystem-quay` pod and press open on the top right corner of the pod to open or run

```execute
oc get routes
```
copy and paste `quayecosystem-quay` url into a new tab.

Once logged in, you'll be presented with the Quay dashboard. Notice a few things here true of a new user:
![Quay Dashboard](images/lab1-1.png)

* Quay presents 3 Links at the top of the page (EXPLORE, REPOSITORIES, and TUTORIAL). The `TUTORIAL` link walks you through the full cycle of pushing an image into your Quay instance. This is great any time you need a quick refresher.
* You have no `Organizations` created. However, you can create repositories under your username, which acts somewhat like an Organization.
* The UI is prompting you to `Create New Organization` on the right.

*Note: Organization names must be globally unique to your Quay instance. For example, if you attempt to create an organization named `user1`, Quay will prevent you from creating this Org, because by default, each user starts with an org created in their account using their username. Repositories, however, are only required to be unique within a given organizations namespace. As an example the following two repos can co-exist without collision:*

```
myquay.com/user1/repo1

myquay.com/user2/repo1
```

## Create an Organization
Let's start by creating an Organization.
* Click - `Create New Organization`

![Quay Dashboard](images/lab1-1.png)

* Name this Organization `userXorg`, where `X` is your assigned user number.


* Click `Create Organization`

## Create a Repository
![Quay Dashboard](images/lab1-3.png)

* Click `Create New Repository` in the top right of the UI.

* Ensure `userXorg` is selected in the drop down list of Organizations.

* Name the organization `test`.

* Change the `Repository Visibility` to `Public`.

* Optionally, set a repository description by clicking in and changing the default text that states `Click to set repository description`

* Click `Create Public Repository`

![Quay Dashboard](images/lab1-4.png)

* Navigate back to the dashboard by clicking the `RED HAT QUAY` icon in the top left of the page.
* Notice you now have two organizations, `userX` and `userXorg`. Your `userXorg` organization contains one repository named `test`.
